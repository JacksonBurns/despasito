SAFT
=======================

The Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT) equation of state (EOS) is based on first order perturbation of the residual Helmholtz energy. The total Helmholtz energy is then defined as the sum of ideal gas, monomer (i.e. segment or group), chain (i.e. component), and association terms.

:math:`\frac{A}{N k_{B} T}=\frac{A^{ideal}}{N k_{B} T}+\frac{A^{mono.}}{N k_{B} T}+\frac{A^{chain}}{N k_{B} T}+\frac{A^{assoc.}}{N k_{B} T}`

The ideal and association terms are defined in the main saft object. The monomer and chain terms (or others such as :math:`A^{elec.}` for electrolytes) are defined in a more specific object that the main ``saft`` class will import. This secondary class will provide the radial distribution function used by the association term with the method, ``gr_assoc``.

SAFT-ùõæ-Mie
-----------------------

EOS type: ``saft.gamma_mie``

This heteronuclear version of SAFT uses the Mie potential to not only offer a group contribution EOS but a means to connect thermodynamic properties to bead definitions that can be simulated.
